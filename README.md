RTBMS is a MERN-based web app for managing blood donations and requests in real time. Users can register, request blood, set locations via maps, and reset passwords via email. An admin dashboard tracks donors, blood banks, and live statistics with a dynamic Three.js interface and MongoDB storage.
The platform is designed to streamline blood donation and request management through a centralized, real-time web application. Users can securely register as donors, request blood, and update their precise location using integrated map functionality. The system features authentication with sign-up, sign-in, and email-based password reset. An interactive admin dashboard enables efficient handling of blood requests, monitoring of donor profiles, and tracking of blood availability across multiple blood banks. It also displays dynamic analytics such as live user count, total registered users, and overall blood donations. The UI is built with Three.js to deliver a modern, dynamic user experience. Additional features include an About page powered by the Unsplash Image API and a Contact page with direct WhatsApp redirection. All application data is securely stored and managed using MongoDB.
