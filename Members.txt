Project Description:

Our Aim is modernizing the facility of donating blood and finding
donors as soon as possible so that no one suffers in the case of urgency.
For the same, we want to develop an __ that will contain the real time 
database of all the blood banks in your locality stating the units of
blood available with its characteristics, real time requisition for 
blood by individuals. The user can track the nearby hospitals/blood 
banks and even the events being conducted by them with the help of geo-tracking.
